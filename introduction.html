        <span style="margin-left: 100px">Robotics</span> is the branch of
        technology that deals with the planning, construction, operation, and
        application of robots also as computer systems for his or her control,
        sensory feedback and knowledge processing. A humanoid robot is a robot
        that not only resembles humans’Physical attributes especially one head,
        a torso, and two armsbut also should have the capability to communicate
        with humansand other robots, interpret information, and perform
        limitedactivities according to the user’s input. Humanoid robots
        areequipped with sensors and actuators. These robots are
        typicallypre-programmed for determined specific activities. Why do we
        need a human robot? Why is every human dependent on every other person
        rather than doing his work by his own? Why every human doeswant its life
        to be easy? Why every human wants all work to be done in seconds and
        minutes rather than in hours? This all “why’s” has an answer that is
        human nature is meant to be easy and wants its life to simple but easy
        living all the humans are tired to live a busy life and they want
        someone who can takeaway some part of their work and do it in minutes so
        that everyone can spend some time with their loved ones.There are many
        sorts of robots but all of them have three aspects in common. They need
        a mechanical construction, a form or shape; Electrical, within the sort
        of wires, sensors, and a few levels of programming.The mechanical
        structure of a robot must be controlled to perform task. Even the
        control of a robot can be occurred in different levels namely, complete
        control and autonomous. Human – Robot interaction is possible by
        inputting the data such as speech recognition, voice, gestures, facial
        expressions, artificial emotions, and personality to the robot. In
        humans they identify someone by structure, appearance and look. Humans
        used to understand the language they were speaking. But this is not the
        case with a robot. There we must teach the robot. We can do this with
        different kind of algorithms in machine learning. The study of motion in
        robots is often divided into kinematics and dynamics. Direct kinematics
        refers to the calculation of end effectors position, orientation,
        velocity, and acceleration when the corresponding joint values are
        known. Inverse kinematics refers to the other case during which required
        joint values are calculated for given end effectors values, as wiped-out
        path planning. Similarly, direct dynamics refers to the calculation of
        accelerations within the robot once the applied forces are known. This
        is often utilized in computer simulations of the robot. Inverse dynamics
        refers to the calculation of the actuator forces necessary to make
        prescribed end-effectors acceleration.Face recognition and detection
        system is used for authentication and identification of human face. In
        face recognition system, it identifies faces within the images
        automatically and mechanically. It's classified into 2 modules - Face
        verification (or authentication), Faceidentification (or recognition).
        Various algorithms are used for verification and identification and each
        algorithm has its unique way.Speech recognition technology enables
        computers to take spoken audio, and then processed it into an electrical
        signal. Speech recognition sometimes is also referred as Automatic
        Speech Recognition (ASR).Deep neural networks have become a popular
        approach in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems that combine good
        acoustic with a language model, but they cannot handle speech data well
        as they don't have a way to feed information to the previous layer.
        Thus, RNN has been introduced to take this drawback into account.
        However, RNN has disadvantages like vanishing and exploding gradients.
        Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) was introduced to overcome this, which is
        a particular type o RNN. Using LSTM in speech recognition has
        significantly achieved the best word error rate. MFCC, Pre-processing
        technique that helps to convert the datasets containing audio and
        transcripts into machine understandable language.We have used Voice
        recognition kit this kit is used to help the robot recognize the
        pre-saved questions, Apr 9600 voice playback kit which is used to play
        all the pre-saved answers. Generally, humanoid robots have a torso, a
        head, two arms, and two legs. Some humanoid robots can also have heads
        designed to duplicate human countenance like eyes and mouths. A humanoid
        design could be for functional purposes, like interacting with human
        tools and environments, for experimental purposes, like the study of
        bipedal locomotion, or other purposes.The objective of this project is
        to develop a reliable and nice-looking humanoid platform which allows
        the implementation of varied theories and algorithms like dynamic
        walking, human interaction, AI (Artificial Intelligence), visual & image
        recognition, and navigation. By the help of 3D modeling, it exactly
        looks like human being.
